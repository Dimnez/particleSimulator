🕹 🔬 simple particle simulation for the web

# About

This project is a small particle simulator. Primarily I built it to test and improve my canvas library [canvasElements](https://github.com/Dimnez/CanvasElements) . Feel free to use the code in whatever way you like.   

# Run

You need webpack, node and [canvasElements](https://github.com/Dimnez/CanvasElements) to build this application.

1. Put './CanvasElements/ in the parent to the './particleSimulator/ folder
2. Run 'npm install' in the './particleGame' folder
3. Run 'npx webpack'
4. Open the public/index.html in a browser
